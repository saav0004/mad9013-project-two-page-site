                One-shots are snack-sized adventures that allow you to get right
                into the action of Dungeons & Dragons without the baggage that
                comes with an extended campaign. In addition, the self-contained
                nature of one-shots enables players and Dungeon Masters to more
                easily experiment with the breadth of options D&D provides
                without commitment. Maybe you want to play as a party of meme
                characters, complete with janky multiclassing shenanigans? Or
                perhaps your DM wants to try their hardest to brutally kill the
                characters one by one? Whatever avenue you're looking to explore
                with your one-shot, it can make for a fun night of gaming!
              </p>
              <p>
                In this article, we're paying homage to one-shot adventures in
                D&D. We'll discuss why we love them, some tips for running them,
                and our favorite one-shot adventures!

              <p>
                One-shots are D&D adventures that can be finished in one 3-4
                hour session. These adventures are more streamlined because of
                the tight turnaround time. One-shot adventures are usually meant
                to be self-contained, not needing any context from outside of
                the adventure to be run.

              <h2 class="article_h2">Why we love One-Shots</h2>
              <p>
                One-shots are a casual way to get a session of D&D in without
                the legwork that comes with a campaign. Players can try out new
                builds and personalities, while DMs don't have to worry about
                managing a campaign, keeping notes, or writing a continuous
                narrative.
              </p>
              <p>
                Seeing as one-shots lack the commitment of an extended campaign,
                they provide a number of unique benefits:

              <h3 class="article_h3">Switch Up the Group Dynamic</h3>
              <p>
                One-shots are the perfect time to allow aspiring DMs at your
                table to step up for a session. While long-term campaigns might
                be daunting for a new DM, one-session adventures that don't
                require as much backstory, planning, and management are
                excellent ways to gain experience. One of the most prominent
                benefits of this is that it gives your table's "forever DM" a
                break.
              </p>
              <p>
                While switching up DMs is one of the best ways to experience a
                different table dynamic, switching party roles can be another
                way to completely change the feel of your game. Maybe your
                peaceful cleric is tired of healing your party and wants to rage
                as a barbarian? Or maybe your warlock wants to go on the
                straight and narrow with a paladin?

              <h3 class="article_h3">Try New Things</h3>
              <p>
                If you're anything like me, you have 10 janky character builds
                ready to go at all times. One-shots are the perfect time to try
                out your new creations without the stakes of being stuck with
                the same character for 100 sessions (or until they meet their
                untimely demise).
              </p>
              <p>
                This can also allow you to experiment with different campaign
                settings. If your group is used to playing in a traditional
                fantasy setting, one-shots are an excellent way to expand your
                horizons. The adventure anthology

                could be an ideal starting point for tables looking to
                experience unique takes on fantasy while sticking to the
                one-session adventure format.

              <h3 class="article_h3">Play D&D Without the Strings</h3>
              <p>
                Agreeing to play D&D usually comes with a commitment. If your
                group can't dedicate a night every week (or two … or four …. or
                eight) to D&D, one-shots are the perfect option to get some game
                time while you have everyone together. If you're hanging out
                with friends and looking for something to do, a one-shot is much
                easier to put together than a campaign!
              </p>
              <p>
                One-shots are also a great way to introduce new players to the
                game. The focus on straightforward gameplay will help streamline
                the player's learning, and the reduced obligation can make
                things easier for those with a busy schedule. You can even help
                the newer players by offering pregenerated characters, so they
                can focus on gameplay rather than the myriad of options they're
                presented with during

              <p>
                Personally, my time to run a one-shot is for a holiday, like
                Halloween, Valentine's Day, or Christmas. One-shots work
                particularly well for the over-the-top spooky or goofy themes
                these celebrations often inspire. While these grandiose tropes
                would get tiresome over the course of an extended campaign,
                one-shots are often the perfect dose of festive holiday spirit!

              <h2 class="article_h2">Tips for Running One-Shots</h2>
              <p>
                While they may not have as many gears as a full-blown campaign,
                one-shots can be deceptively tricky to run well. Of course,
                there are a few aspects that make them better for newer DMs or
                DMs looking for a break—less worldbuilding, a streamlined story,
                and throwaway characters—but the session itself requires more
                oversight than your typical session. In a regular campaign, if
                the players get off the rails and spend hours adopting a group
                of goblins, it's no big deal and can even make for a funny
                improv session. On the other hand, one-shots need to stay on
                track, or they will take longer than the single prescribed
                session.
              </p>
              <p>
                As long as there aren't any restrictions with your table, it's
                usually not a huge deal if your one-shot turns into a two- or
                three-shot. But if you're looking to run a compelling
                one-session adventure, here are some tips:
              </p>
            </article>
            <article class="content__article">
              <h3 class="article_h3">Keep the Intro Short</h3>
              <p>
                When time is of the essence, introducing characters and
                establishing the story needs to be fast-forwarded compared to a
                long-term campaign. If it takes the party an hour to describe
                their characters, decide if they want to work together, then
                negotiate their contract, you'll probably have to cut things
                from your planned adventure.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've found an excellent method of expediting this process is to
                send players the introduction for the adventure ahead of time. I
                ask them to brainstorm ahead of time how their characters know one another. Then, on game day, I kick off the one-shot by
                describing how the characters got their quest and the
                information they need to know. This allows me to jump straight
                into the action without distraction.
              </p>
            </article>
            <article class="content__article">
              <h3 class="article_h3">Expedite Combat</h3>
              <p>
                Combat is usually the most time-consuming element of D&D. While
                it can be fun for players to test their character's abilities,
                the last few rounds of combat can drag on if the battle is
                wildly in favor of the party.
              </p>
              <p>
                The best way to reduce the time investment required for combat
                is to set a "retreat scenario" for the party's opposition. Maybe
                the bandits your party is facing will run if their leader is
                killed? Or perhaps an owlbear with less than half of its hit
                points can be scared away with a Charisma (Intimidation) check?
              </p>
              <p>
                Having alternate win conditions for combat allows the party to
                still feel satisfied with their victory while giving you more
                time for social interactions and exploration!
              </p>
            </article>
            <article class="content__article">
              <h3 class="article_h3">Vary the Play</h3>
              <p>
                While a combat-heavy session in a long-term campaign can be
                balanced out by having a roleplay-heavy session the following
                time you play, one-shots don't have that luxury. This means that
                one-shots should visit all aspects of D&D play—combat,
                exploration, and social interaction—to ensure that players are
                given a chance to make their character feel effective.
                Barbarians might love an entire session of crushing their foes,
                but maybe the rogue wants to do some sneaking while the bard
                chats up a bartender for information?
              </p>
              <p>
                Including the three core aspects of D&D gameplay in a one-shot
                makes for a good one-shot, but a great one-shot intersperses
                these scenarios throughout the adventure to avoid any one aspect
                becoming stale. Think of your one-shot as a lasagna; you should
                layer your sauce, cheese, and noodles (combat, exploration, and
                social interaction in this metaphor) so that every bite has
                enough of each!

                adventure features a climactic final encounter where the party
                has to escape a ship being attacked by a kraken that I am
                particularly fond of.
