## Comments

### HTML
Search for `prof feedback` in individual files for specific comments.

### CSS
Search for `prof feedback` in individual files for specific comments.

### Responsive Design
Overall it looks great! A really picky comment: make sure that everything is aligned perfectly. The padding on the left and right sides of the content varies from section to section. Some have `1.5rem`, others have `1rem`, some have `2rem`. It is a small thing, but having perfectly consistent alignment is how you make your work truly professional!
